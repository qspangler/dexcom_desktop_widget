# dexcom_desktop_widget
Desktop display for live Dexcom readings.

Run script from command line, enter your Dexcom/Clarity login credentials, and receive live blood sugar updates on your desktop.

Choose between glucose value view, or a line graph view (examples displayed below).

Feel free to adjust code to better reflect your personal blood sugar ranges. 

Feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Currently working on getting this to be a standalone, downloadable app as opposed to the current state of running locally in python.
